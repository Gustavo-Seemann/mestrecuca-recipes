# ü•ê MestreCuca Recipes

MestreCuca Recipes is a personal project prototyped and developed by me (Luiz Gustavo Seemann) in Nuxt.js.


I used Nuxt 3 and TailwindCSS for the Front-end, integrating with the FreeMealAPI.


The idea of the website is to be a recipe blog from a brand known as MestreCuca, allowing you to discover and see recipes for food from different types and countries.
